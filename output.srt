1
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,333
Boom. Nailed it.

2
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:35,213
Oh, hi.

3
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:45,725
What brings you to this part of the video?

4
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:07,946
I was hoping that I could talk to you guys through annotations, but subtitles will have to do.

5
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:30,906
Why did they take annotations away? Seems like Youtube is blowing it every day.

6
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,125
Anyways.

7
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:49,927
This is KJAZZ. It's the local jazz radio station out of Long Beach.

8
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,440
It's chill, especially on nice rainy days like this one.

9
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:29,168
I'd highly suggest that everyone learn about their local radio stations, actually.

10
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:54,156
You'll find your local conservative radio station, I'm sure.

11
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:17,852
That one is especially fascinating, the way that they signal to their religious base and choose what topics to cover.

12
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:54,542
Also it seems like every other interview they have is with someone who gets cut off mid-interview for saying something that doesn't agree with their agenda.

13
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:12,181
It's brilliant, the way they do it. They don't even say bye to the guest.

14
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:30,137
One minute they're talking and giving an answer, the next they're gone.

15
00:09:49,667 --> 00:10:00,333
This cover is interesting... it pulled me in because I grew up on Indiana Jones like most 31 year olds

16
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,604
but is it actually good? I don't know.

17
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:36,269
But I keep paying attention to find that they've changed the words to be about today's politics!

18
00:10:56,517 --> 00:11:06,184
Another strike against them, at least I know I won't get any re-listens from something that's so specific.

19
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:26,334
Would you relisten to a song that's this topical?

20
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,929
But alas, I'm a hater.

21
00:11:47,114 --> 00:12:00,114
Anyway, you might also have a crazy liberal radio station to pair with the crazy conservative radio station.

22
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:30,617
The best I can describe it as the worst of Democracy Now! interviews... over and over.

23
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:14,479
It seems like most of the people they talk to have nothing concrete to say, instead rambling about bad energy and demonizing the conservatives.

24
00:13:50,556 --> 00:14:06,889
These guys will also censor what they cover and what they won't. For example they won't let someone say that  the DNC sabotaged Sanders' campaign in favor of Hillary.

25
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,377
I'm rambling myself, at this point.

26
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,179
Ironic.

27
00:14:57,038 --> 00:15:03,038
So this is the fabled 405 North. It's my least favorite freeway on Earth.

28
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:33,220
My favorite is the 13 in northern California. It's a windy thing that you can take quite fast late at night.

29
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:37,428
Deja Vu!

30
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:45,470
Sorry, wrong genre.

31
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:53,869
This tune is pretty nice, right?

32
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:29,990
I think so. But I've realized that the best way to really get through bad traffic is to sing. I don't think I'll film any of those, but it's just something I've noticed.

33
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:46,401
Singing is hard and I'm not particularly good at it.

34
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:30,044
This video goes well as a pairing with a nice Skywalker OG preroll because you're a lazy piece of shit and you're willing to pay extra to not roll them yourself.

35
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:57,671
Have they talked yet?

36
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:19,731
I was planning on not typing during the talking out of respect for the person talking...

37
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:52,929
Anyway, the world is divided. That's all I'm really saying. And it's really fun to learn about how divided it is and how they're dividing us.

38
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:29,383
That's all. Read ZeroHedge every once in a while to understand what those people think. Do the same with Vox.

39
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,135
Excuse me...

40
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:58,131
I should donate.

41
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:44,976
Oh I guess we're back at music again! Anyway. I might do this later with some of my favorite albums. That might be interesting to give commentary on the music itself.

42
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:07,054
I smoked more during the talking, so excuse me if I slow down.

43
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:21,872
So I'm going to be driving up to the LAX airport, more or less.

44
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:47,706
This was a surprisingly easy drive given how much it was raining. Not sure how I always dodge the traffic.

45
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:09,592
So what else is happening in the world? Have you ever felt like music stopped happening around 2001?

46
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:49,687
I have. I think it has to do with the establishment of a "Second Top 40" list that they call "Adult Alternative"

47
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:56,770
or something like that.

48
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:28,285
I heard it on NPR, it was pretty fascinating. But that's probably just because I like music (though I hope you do too if you're watching this!).

49
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:55,977
Or maybe you have this turned off and you're just studying. I need to put that in the title so everyone knows what this is really for.

50
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:28,123
For others, thinking about a second top 40 and all that is probably like that stupid story about the history of the penny.

51
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:52,508
Oh man this song sounds like Snake Eater, doesn't it? The one from Metal Gear Solid 3.

52
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:00,346
I'll link it in the dubleydoo.

53
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:23,045
Please Like, Subscribe and fuck yourself. It's sex with someone you love.

54
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:31,594
:D <3 :D

55
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:13,331
Anyway. I also wonder if that point in my life is when music stopped for me. Did I somehow close off to new music?

56
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:41,975
The National is a band that I feel so closed off to. I feel like they're so mediocre and so... safe? that it's offensive.

57
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:52,487
Or Coldplay? Same shit.

58
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:21,783
Though Spies is a DOPE song that everyone should listen to. I'll link to that one, it's the only tune that has stood the test of time for me.

59
00:27:48,695 --> 00:28:01,028
I shouldn't say I'll link to things. Should just link to them and show that what I'm doing is a complete Youtube multimedia experience.

60
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,862
Ah I'm getting close!

61
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:39,921
The billboards that I see make me think. What do they mean? Someone's willing to spend money to put that sign up.

62
00:28:56,178 --> 00:29:03,511
Movies are easy but when you see signs for weird expos, it's awesome.

63
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:24,836
Who knew that there were so many people into Underwater Basketweaving?

64
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:32,152
The UBE is going to be sick.

65
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:44,898
Thank you for watching.
